You are a high-fidelity data mapper. Your task is to pair EVERY item from LE-RAW and CD-RAW without exception.

[STANDARD-CATEGORIES]
{{standard-categories}}

[INPUT-DATA]
LE-RAW: {{le-raw-json}}
CD-RAW: {{cd-raw-json}}

[STRICT-RULES]
1. NO MERGING: Even if multiple items belong to Section A, DO NOT combine them. For example, ".25% of Loan Amount (Points)" and "Application Fee" are separate items.
2. EXACT-KEYS: Use the EXACT kebab-case strings from [STANDARD-CATEGORIES] for the "category" field.
3. KEBAB-CASE-ONLY: All JSON keys must be in kebab-case (e.g., "le-item" instead of "le_item").
4. TOTAL-COUNT-CHECK: If the input has 15 items, the output MUST have 15 objects in the array.

[OUTPUT-FORMAT]
Return ONLY a raw JSON array. Use this exact structure:
[
  {
    "category": "loan-origination-points",
    "le": { "description": ".25% of Loan Amount (Points)", "amount": 405.0, "section": "a" },
    "cd": { "description": "0.25% of Loan Amount (Points)", "amount": 405.0, "section": "a", "payee": null }
  }
]
